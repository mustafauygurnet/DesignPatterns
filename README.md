# Desing Patterns

Design Patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are blueprints that can be taken and customized to solve a particular design problem in your code.

This git project, shows you the big picture, how all these subjects intersect, work together, and are still relevant. I don’t pretend to be the inventor of these concepts—most of them were invented by others during the past 20 years. But I think that the connection between refactoring, patterns and general programming principles still remains a mystery for the majority of programmers. This is the problem I would like to solve here.


## What does the pattern consist of?
Most patterns are described very formally so people can reproduce them in many contexts. Here are the sections that are usually present in a pattern description:

- **Intent** of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.
- **Motivation** further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.
- **Structure** of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.
- **Code example** in one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern.
